                            <p>I am a first-year PhD student in Geography and Urban Studies. This spring semester, I am enrolled in Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems with the hopes of learning a new skill to apply in my future research. My research interests lie in anti-displacement strategies in gentrifying neighborhoods and communities. I am extremely interested in working with the Puerto Rican population either in Philadelphia or the archipelago, acknowledging that there have been decades of systemic factors leading to displacement in both geographies. While displacements happen differently, I think there is much to learn from either geography; the story I want to focus on is the Puerto Rican people's resilience and movements for resistance to these changes.</p>

                        <p>By utilizing three datasets, which included Philly neighborhoods, Philly bike routes, and school types, I was able to exhibit which charter schools in Philadelphia had enrollments of over 1200 students and which neighborhoods they were located in. After importing the data into ArcGIS, I then utilized the Attributes function (by pressing Ctrl + T or using the Select by using function in the ribbon). This allowed me to see the data I had to filter through, which included information like class types such as high schools or elementary, demographics, neighborhood locations of the schools, and more. By selecting the specific attributes I needed, in this case charter schools with enrollments over 1200, I could then pinpoint exactly where those schools were. Furthermore, I was able to export data features to highlight those specific attributes against the larger map and dataset (by neighborhoods and the charter school demographics). Later, after all the data was included, I used the symbology function (by double-clicking the boxes and icons to change the aesthetics); I adjusted it so it was visually obvious what schools I wanted to highlight.
<p>For this particular map, I wanted to answer the following question: <i>Where were the large Philadelphia schools that were well connected to the existing bike network?</i></p>

                            <p>I first made sure all my maps and data projections were in the same UTM field. I googled the best projections for Chicago and found that NAD 83 UTM Zone 16N was the best possible one for Chicago-specific data. Various websites confirmed this for me. Then, I proceeded to select the data that solely focused on homicides and created an exported dataset where I would work from, removing any other crime datasets. From there, I was able to summarize by right-clicking on the district field, by district, and count. This gave me the number of homicides committed in each division. A similar technique was used for the Airbnb reviews, but rather I used the number of (which were our reviews), and then once more, the sum. To save this as an extra step, I utilized the price/average options as a second field, and in both datasets, the case fields were still district. My next step was then to join the table to the dataset I was working with (selected crimes) and then export it once again so all the data was accurately joined together in a clean shape form. From there, I was then able to calculate fields for Airbnb data, homicides, and eventually add the field for area by square miles and calculated the geometry which gave me the data I needed that would feed into my choropleth maps. In addition, I was also able to pull statistics to help me see the average prices around the districts (roughly about $108 a night). Interestingly, when you compare the map data, you can see how districts with higher rates of homicide don’t have as dense Airbnb areas with reviews or stays for that matter, which may infer a correlation between crime rates and stays. One thing worth noting is that not all crime rates are calculated in these datasets, as some were without districts and thus not included in the sum count of all the crimes in the district. This is something worth noting on an ethical end because it may not fully be representative of what may be happening.</p>
                            <p>The map I produced shows the number of Airbnb reviews within the police districts, measured within square mile of the district.  For the map I tried to pick a close color schemes to AirBnb's; I chose a pink visual to make it feel more consistent with the marketing materials they utilize; I think where there is consistency in color schemes, there’s an ability to spark recognition over time. I tried to make that clear within the maps I utilized. Lastly, I also included the map from my tutorial practice to continue to show my learning experience with the concepts we are covering in our class. </p>

                        <p>In this lab, we learned a number of new skills. First, we learned how to utilize environments for our work, including a scratch workplace. Second, we learned how to retrieve length and area measurements within our polygons, an extension of our previous lessons with tables. Calculating geometry helped us measure area sizes we were working with. The buffer tools allowed us to further understand how we might be looking at any given space, such as distance. Next, in conjunction with something like the map dissolve tool, we could generalize data that was related (such as counties in the US map or bus and train routes on SEPTA) into a cohesive vector tool that showcased the intersection of those data points. The spatial join tool helped us combine data with other layers and see how things might be geographically contained within the polygon. I want to make a quick note here that this tool was functional, but there were some mishaps I had with it, such as lacking the function of “Field Map of Join Features” on my program. This made it difficult to navigate the tool.

<p>Next, we learned to use the Clip tool to determine and isolate the variables/areas we needed to tell a story, such as cutting out polygons that didn’t have the right bus route or corner stores, and so forth. Following the erase tool, we learned how to remove the pieces that didn’t fall within the correct boundaries required for our map, a tool which I believe will be super relevant moving forward. The Intersecting tool was helpful when we wanted to focus on a specific area, such as empowerment zones and their relation to a store and its distance. In the last portion of the lab, we utilized the Union tool and the Multipart to Singlepart tool. This helped us unify data that was related to form additional layers we wanted intersecting and combined, leading to creating a shapefile that was considerate of both data within one space visually.

<p>I utilized all these tools and steps to help with the way I had data for corner stores and farmer’s markets, SEPTA, and the empowerment zones. These helped me buffer relevant shapefiles together so that I could then unify or clip out irrelevant information to tell the story of my deliverables below.

<p>This map of eligible sites, containing the surrounding corner stores and farmer’s markets, exemplified the need for healthy food stores within the green area of eligible sites.</p>
